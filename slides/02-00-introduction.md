# System Requirements

To perform the exercises on your private computer you need

* _either_ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (16.x, 14.x or 12.x)
* _or_ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

_:information_source: On the university computers Node.js should already
be available. You can verify this by running `node -v` on the command
line. It should display a 12.x (or higher) version._

_:computer: You can always fall back to your personal laptop for the
exercises as it should be free from virtualization, proxying or
installation hurdles!_
